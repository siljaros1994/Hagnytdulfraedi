Assignment Task 3 - 100 % Module 2 Grade
In this assignment you will add cryptography for data both in transit and
at rest to the attached nodejs application. You will write a report illus-
trating the changes you have made in the code and their justification. You
should include evidence of attacks against the system for both data in tran-
sit and at rest. Assume the stored data is at rest. Be sure to customise
the websiteâ€™s HTML for a small business. E.g. logo and name.
Document the following in a report for submission:
1. Evidence attacks for data in transit.
2. Evidence attacks for data at rest.
3. Evidence, describe and justify the changes you have made
to secure the code against these attacks.
